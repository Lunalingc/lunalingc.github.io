He and his brother, Yukio Okumura, were adopted by a priest and were raised in a church community. The priests weren't normal though, they were all exorcists, or demon hunters. Rin and Yukio both want to learn the ways of an exorcist and go the school for upcoming exorcists, True Cross Academy. But with Rin being a demon himself a lot of problems come their way, in the form of friends and enemies. Rin doesn't know how to control his powers and requires a lot of help, but not a lot of people trust him. </p></div>
